Reconstruction Project
==============

This repository follows the development of a new 2D/3D reconstruction algorithm aiming to provide better results than the nearest-neighour method, without adding much complexity and provide some topological guarantees.
The implementation of the 2D algorithm is done in CGAL with its Arrangements package, visualization with QT.
